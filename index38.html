        <h3><b>What is robotics?</b></h3>
        <p>Robotics is the branch of engineering and computer sciences where machines are built to perform programmed tasks without further human intervention.</p>
        <p>A robot will happily do the same exhausting task over and over again each day. A human will get bored, fatigued or both and thatâ€™s when mistakes slip in.</p>
        <p>Robotics is where robots are built and programmed to perform very specific duties</p>
        <h3><b>Components of Robot</b></h3>

        <li>Actuators: Actuators are the devices that are responsible for moving and controlling a system or machine. It helps to achieve physical movements by converting energy like electrical, hydraulic and air, etc. Actuators can create linear as well as rotary motion.</li>
        <li>Power Supply: It is an electrical device that supplies electrical power to an electrical load. The primary function of the power supply is to convert electrical current to power the load.</li>
        <li> Motors: These are the devices that convert electrical energy into mechanical energy and are required for the rotational motion of the machines.</li>
        <li>Pneumatic Air Muscles: Air Muscles are soft pneumatic devices that are ideally best fitted for robotics. They can contract and extend and operate by pressurized air filling a pneumatic bladder. Whenever air is introduced, it can contract up to 40%.</li>
        <li>Muscles wire: These are made up of nickel-titanium alloy called Nitinol and are very thin in shape. It can also extend and contract when a specific amount of heat and electric current is supplied into it. Also, it can be formed and bent into different shapes when it is in its martensitic form. They can contract by 5% when electrical current passes through them.</li>
        <li>Piezo Motors and Ultrasonic Motors: Piezoelectric motors or Piezo motors are the electrical devices that receive an electric signal and apply a directional force to an opposing ceramic plate. It helps a robot to move in the desired direction. These are the best suited electrical motors for industrial robots.</li>
        <li> Sensor: They provide the ability like see, hear, touch and movement like humans. Sensors are the devices or machines which help to detect the events or changes in the environment and send data to the computer processor. These devices are usually equipped with other electronic devices. Similar to human organs, the electrical sensor also plays a crucial role in Artificial Intelligence & robotics. AI algorithms control robots by sensing the environment, and it provides real-time information to computer processors.</li>
