        <p>Till now, we have learned knowledge representation using first-order logic and propositional logic with certainty, which means we were sure about the predicates. With this knowledge representation, we might write Aâ†’B, which means if A is true then B is true, but consider a situation where we are not sure about whether A is true or not then we cannot express this statement, this situation is called uncertainty.</p>
        <h3><b>Probabilistic reasoning:</b></h3>
        <p>Probabilistic reasoning is a way of knowledge representation where we apply the concept of probability to indicate the uncertainty in knowledge. In probabilistic reasoning, we combine probability theory with logic to handle the uncertainty.</p>
        <p>In the real world, there are lots of scenarios, where the certainty of something is not confirmed, such as "It will rain today," "behavior of someone for some situations," "A match between two teams or two players." These are probable sentences for which we can assume that it will happen but not sure about it, so here we use probabilistic reasoning.</p>
        <p>In probabilistic reasoning, there are two ways to solve problems with uncertain knowledge:</p>
        <li>Bayes' rule</li>
        <li>Bayesian Statistics</li>
        <h3><b>Conditional probability:</b></h3>
        <p>Conditional probability is a probability of occurring an event when another event has already happened.
        </p>
        <li>Let's suppose, we want to calculate the event A when event B has already occurred, "the probability of A under the conditions of B", it can be written as:</li>
        <p>p(A|B)=P(A^B)/P(B)</p>
