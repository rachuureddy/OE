        <p>Each variable in R has an associated data type. Each data type requires different amounts of memory and has some specific operations which can be performed over it. R Programming language has the following basic data types and the following table shows the data type and the values that each data type can take.</p>

        <p><b>Numeric Datatype</b>-</p>
            <p>Decimal values are called numerics in R. It is the default data type for numbers in R. If you assign a decimal value to a variable x as follows, x will be of numeric type.</p>
            <p>When R stores a number in a variable, it converts the number into a “double” value or a decimal type with at least two decimal places. This means that a value such as “5” here, is stored as 5.00 with a type of double and a class of numeric. And also y is not an integer here can be confirmed with the is.integer() function.</p>
            <p><b>Integer Datatype</b>-</p>
            <p>R supports integer data types which are the set of all integers. You can create as well as convert a value into an integer type using the as.integer() function. You can also use the capital ‘L’ notation as a suffix to denote that a particular value is of the integer data type.</p>
            <p><b>Logical Datatype</b>-</p>
            <p>R has logical data types that take either a value of true or false. A logical value is often created via a comparison between variables. </p>
            <p><b>Complex Datatype</b>-</p>
            <p>R supports complex data types that are set of all the complex numbers. The complex data type is to store numbers with an imaginary component. </p>
            <p><b>Character Datatype</b>-</p>
            <p>R supports character data types where you have all the alphabets and special characters. It stores character values or strings. Strings in R can contain alphabets, numbers, and symbols. The easiest way to denote that a value is of character type in R is to wrap the value inside single or double inverted commas. </p>
