<p>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:</p>
<p>car1 = "Ford"</p>
<p>car2 = "Volvo"</p>
<p>car3 = "BMW"</p>
<p>An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

</p>
<h3>Adding Elements to a Array</h3>
<p>Elements can be added to the Array by using built-in insert() function. Insert is used to insert one or more data elements into an array. Based on the requirement, a new element can be added at the beginning, end, or any given index of array. append() is also used to add the value mentioned in its arguments at the end of the array. </p>
<h3>Removing Elements from the Array</h3>
<p>Elements can be removed from the array by using built-in remove() function but an Error arises if element doesnâ€™t exist in the set. Remove() method only removes one element at a time, to remove range of elements, iterator is used. pop() function can also be used to remove and return an element from the array, but by default it removes only the last element of the array, to remove element from a specific position of the array, index of the element is passed as an argument to the pop() method.
</p>
<h3>Updating Elements in a Array</h3>
<p>In order to update an element in the array we simply reassign a new value to the desired index we want to update. </p>
