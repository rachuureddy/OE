        <li><b>Open-source</b>-R in data science is free software that is accessible to everyone. Furthermore, the programming language is adaptable, making it easy to integrate with different applications and processes. Despite being open-source software, the programming language exudes quality and is usable and versatile.</li><br></br>
        <li><b>Powerful graphics</b>-This is one of the attractive features of R programming. Many data scientists use R while analyzing data because it has static graphics that produce good-quality data visualizations. Moreover, the programming language has a comprehensive library that provides interactive graphics and makes data visualization and representation easy to analyze. From elaborative and interactive flow diagrams to bar graphs, R has everything that makes data analysis enigmatic and easy.</li><br></br>
        <li><b> Widely used</b>-R fosters a community of its own. The programming language is widely used by data scientists and business leaders across the globe because it is an open-source computer system that evokes a sense of community among its users.</li><br></br>
        <li><b>Performs complex statistical calculations</b>-Râ€™s wide popularity is because of its ability to perform simple and complex mathematical and statistical calculations. It is also used for analyzing data in many industries.</li><br></br>
        <li><b>Compatibility</b>-R is compatible with computer programs like C, C++, Java, Python, etc. Its functions can be easily integrated into different computer programs.
            These features and more make R a favourite choice of many data scientists. Interestingly, web applications like Twitter, Google analytics, BBC, others use R in data science. They use it to collect data and create clear data visualizations or graphs to draw inferences and implement their business conclusions. If you are a data scientist wondering how to procure R for data analysis, proceed to the next section wherein we have explained how to install the R program below.</li><br></br>
