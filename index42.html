        <p>Data structures are very important to understand. Data structure are the objects which we will manipulate in our day-to-day basis in R. Dealing with object conversions is the most common sources of despairs for beginners. We can say that everything in R is an object.</p>
        <p>R has many data structures, which include:</p>
        <li>Atomic vector</li>
        <li>List</li>
        <li> Array</li>
        <li> Matrices</li>
        <li>Data Frame</li>
        <li>Factors</li>
        <h3><b>Vectors</b></h3>
        <p>A vector is the basic data structure in R, or we can say vectors are the most basic R data objects. There are six types of atomic vectors such as logical, integer, character, double, and raw. "A vector is a collection of elements which is most commonly of mode character, integer, logical or numeric" A vector can be one of the following two types:</p>
        <li>Atomic vector</li>
        <li>Lists</li>
        <h3><b>List</b></h3>
        <p>In R, the list is the container. Unlike an atomic vector, the list is not restricted to be a single mode. A list contains a mixture of data types. The list is also known as generic vectors because the element of the list can be of any type of R object. "A list is a special type of vector in which each element can be a different type."</p>
        <h3><b>Arrays</b></h3>
        <p>There is another type of data objects which can store data in more than two dimensions known as arrays. "An array is a collection of a similar data type with contiguous memory allocation." Suppose, if we create an array of dimension (2, 3, 4) then it creates four rectangular matrices of two rows and three columns.</p>


        <p>In R, an array is created with the help of array() function. This function takes a vector as an input and uses the value in the dim parameter to create an array.</p>
        <h3><b>Matrices</b></h3>
        <p>A matrix is an R object in which the elements are arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular layout. In the matrix, elements of the same atomic types are contained. For mathematical calculation, this can use a matrix containing the numeric element. A matrix is created with the help of the matrix() function in R.</p>
        <h3><b>Data Frames</b></h3>
        <p>A data frame is a two-dimensional array-like structure, or we can say it is a table in which each column contains the value of one variable, and row contains the set of value from each column.</p>
        <p>There are the following characteristics of a data frame:</p>
        <li>The column name will be non-empty.</li>
        <li>The row names will be unique.</li>
        <li>A data frame stored numeric, factor or character type data.</li>
        <li>Each column will contain same number of data items.</li>
        <h3><b>Factors</b></h3>
        <p>Factors are also data objects that are used to categorize the data and store it as levels. Factors can store both strings and integers. Columns have a limited number of unique values so that factors are very useful in columns. It is very useful in data analysis for statistical modeling.</p>

        <P>Factors are created with the help of factor() function by taking a vector as an input parameter.</p>
