    <h1 style="color:Tomato;">1.What are OOP's concepts?</h1>
    <h3>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.</h3>
   <h3>object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</h3>
   <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
   <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
   <li>OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
   <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
   <h3> It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:</h3>
   <li>Object</li>
   <li>Class
    <li> Inheritance</li>
    <li>Polymorphism</li>
    <li>Abstraction</li>
    <li>Encapsulation</li>
    <br></br>
    <h3>1.Object</h3>
    <p>An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory.</p>
    <p>Example: A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well as behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.</p>
    <h3>2.Class</h3>
    <p>Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.</p>
    <p>A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.</p>
   
    <h3>3.Inheritance</h3>
    <p>When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism..</p>
    <h3>4.Polymorphism</h3>
    <p>If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.</p>
    <p>In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.</p>
<p>Another example can be to speak something; for example, a cat speaks meow, dog barks woof, etc.</p>
<h3>4.Abstraction</h3>
<p>Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.</p>
<p>In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

    <h3>5.Encapsulation</h3>
    <h3>A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.</h3>
