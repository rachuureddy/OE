    <h3>Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

    It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.
    
    It is used for:<h3>

        <h1 style="color:Tomato;">3.Describe features of java?</h1>
        <h2>There are many features in java :</h2>
        <ul style="font-size:larger;">
            <b>
        <li>Simple: Java is a simple language because its syntax is simple, clean, and easy to understand. Complex and ambiguous concepts of C++ are either eliminated or re-implemented in Java. For example, pointer and operator overloading are not used in Java.</li>
        <br></br>
        <li> Object-Oriented: In Java, everything is in the form of the object. It means it has some data and behavior. A program must have at least one class and object.
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>Robust: Java makes an effort to check error at run time and compile time. It uses a strong memory management system called garbage collector. Exception handling and garbage collection features make it strong.</li><br></br>
        <li>Secure: Java is a secure programming language because it has no explicit pointer and programs runs in the virtual machine. Java contains a security manager that defines the access of Java classes.</li><br></br>
        <li>Platform-Independent: Java provides a guarantee that code writes once and run anywhere. This byte code is platform-independent and can be run on any machine.</li><br></br>
        <li>Portable: Java Byte code can be carried to any platform. No implementation-dependent features. Everything related to storage is predefined, for example, the size of primitive data types.</li><br></br>
        <li>High Performance: Java is an interpreted language. Java enables high performance with the use of the Just-In-Time compiler.</li><br></br>
        <li>Distributed: Java also has networking facilities. It is designed for the distributed environment of the internet because it supports TCP/IP protocol. It can run over the internet. EJB and RMI are used to create a distributed system.</li><br></br>
        <li>Multi-threaded: Java also supports multi-threading. It means to handle more than one job a time.</li>
