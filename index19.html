    <p>Java brings various Streams with its I/O package that helps the user to perform all the input-output operations. These streams support all the types of objects, data-types, characters, files etc to fully execute the I/O operations.

    </p>
    <p>3 standard or default streams that Java has to provide which are also most common in use:

    </p>
    <li>System.in: This is the standard input stream that is used to read characters from the keyboard or any other standard input device.</li><br></br>
<li>System.out: This is the standard output stream that is used to produce the result of a program on an output device like the computer screen.</li>
<h5>print(): This method in Java is used to display a text on the console.</h5>
<h5>println(): This method is also Java is used to display a text on the console.</h5>
<h5>printf(): This is the easiest of all methods as this is similar to printf in C.</h5>
<li>System.err: This is the standard error stream that is used to output all the error data that a program might throw, on a computer screen or any standard output device.
    This stream also uses all the 3 above-mentioned functions to output the error data:</li>
    <h5>print()</h5>
    <h5>println()</h5>
    <h5>printf()</h5>
