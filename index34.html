        <p>There are far too many powerful search algorithms out there to fit in a single article. Instead, this article will discuss six of the fundamental search algorithms, divided into two categories, as shown below. </p>

        <h2><b>Uninformed Search Algorithms: </b></h2>
        <p>The search algorithms in this section have no additional information on the goal node other than the one provided in the problem definition. The plans to reach the goal state from the start state differ only by the order and/or length of actions. Uninformed search is also called Blind search. These algorithms can only generate the successors and differentiate between the goal state and non goal state. </p>

        <h2><b>Informed Search Algorithms: </b></h2>
        <p>Here, the algorithms have information on the goal state, which helps in more efficient searching. This information is obtained by something called a heuristic. </p>
        <li>Greedy Search</li><br></br>

        <li> A* Graph Search</li><br></br>
